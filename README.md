# SomeTrails

SomeTrails is an innovative online platform designed to offer a comprehensive database of hiking trails, tailored to both novice and experienced hikers.
Our goal is to help users easily discover trails that match their skill level and preferences while providing advanced search and filtering tools to enhance your hiking experience.

Hikers often struggle to find detailed, reliable information about trails that suit their experience level and preferences. 
SomeTrails addresses these issues by creating a user-friendly platform with an extensive, curated database of hiking trails.

## Dependencies

SomeTrails uses Docker and Docker Compose for deployment and dependency management. 
As such, the only dependencies are Git and a working installation of Docker.
